# About Me
👋 I'm Natalie! I've been working in data and product- based roles for over 10 years.  

Currently, I am a freelance data consultant where I empower my small business clients to unlock the true potential of their data. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, I enable them to make informed decisions that drive improvements in retention, acquisition, and revenue growth.

Amidst the pandemic, fueled by my extra time and a growing dissatisfaction with the inadequate focus on women's sports, I took action and played a pivotal role in the creation of a fantasy sports web app dedicated exclusively to women's sports. Our platform hosts captivating fantasy competitions for both the NWSL and the Olympics, with more coming soon!

I'm also a mom, runner, and USWNT fanatic. ⚽️🇺🇸
